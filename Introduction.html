<h3><a id="Owner and History">Owner and History</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
Stardome Observatory is a public astronomical observatory situated in Cornwall Park, One Tree Hill Domain in Auckland. Founded in 1967, the observatory is administered by the Auckland Observatory and Planetarium Trust Board. Since that time it has become a facility for people of all ages and interests to enjoy.
<br>The Planetarium theatre was opened on the site in 1997 as a result of an ambitious vision from Obseravatory Trustees and Management.
<br>Major funding came from the Lotteries Commission, the ASB Community Trust and a loan from Auckland City Council as well as from the public of Auckland. The older projectors were replaced in 2008 with fully digitised system along with upgraded seating, projection screen, interactive displays and exhibits in the Planetarium. Stardome also provides expert personalised assistance from astronomy educators and presenters.
<br>After I used the database of <a href="https://who.is/" target="new"> WHOIS query and response protocol</a> against the observatory website address, I got the details about domain and IP owner information, history of domain registration and other statistics such as traffic data, etc. Here I provided the snapshots of the WHOIS queries. I decided to keep the size of them optimal for the clear displaying of information. <br>

<p align="justify">For networking and security purpose the traceroute information can be also retrieved. It exposes the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

<p align="justify"> In regarding to the history of design changing the <a href="http://web.archive.org/" target="new">Web Archive</a> provides collection of snapshots taken at different years starting from 1998. There is some degree of evolution of the website design which can be seen in the next image.

There are few sections included in my report which cover discussion about visual design, multimedia elements, technique details along with navigation of the website, its usability and accessibility, copyright and ownership. In the other section of my reports I provided my opinion on how the observatory website design can be improved, main highlights and design principles which I used for building my report in the form of website. Also the references to the material can be seen in the section References of the Menu.
