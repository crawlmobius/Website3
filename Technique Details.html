<h3>Meta Tags:</h3>
<p>Metadata has great value, particularly to search engines. Correct use of metadata can improve your placement in search engines, but more importantly how your website appears when in a search engine. In particular, the description meta tag, is frequently shown in Google beneath the link to a specific result.
<p>On investigating the HTML Source of the Website,  I found that all pages are having meta description.
