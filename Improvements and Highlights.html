<h3><a id="#Visual Design">Visual Design:</a></h3>
<p>The visual design of the website is very impressive and engaging. The balance between graphics and text is wisely maintained. The Website can be easily viewed in multiple screen resolutions. 
Personally I would add the rollover effect for the menu buttons in the drop down menu. When mouse is rolling over, the button currently stays the same. I think adding the effect will not only bring the visual design benefit, but also it will send the responsive feedback to the user. 

<h3><a id="#Sound, Video, Animation">Sound, Video, Animation:</a></h3>
<p>Despite the website has the video feature for selected shows, this in my opinion needs some work, because currently it takes a lot of time to load it.  Also I would incorporate some flash effect as being planetarium web site, it gives a lot of opportunities to create elegant and attractive features which will leave long lasting impression on the viewers.

<h3><a id="#Overuse of Images">Overuse of Images:</a></h3>
<p>On Main page there are 27 images, this will increase the web page opening delay. Most of the images are in jpg format. To achieve smaller image sizes , png format can be used instead of jpg.
<p>Also by clever combining 2 or more images the count of images can be decreased.

<h3><a id="#Meta tags">Meta tags</a></h3>
<p>All the pages are having meta description. This is good because search engines show this text in search result pages.

<h3><a id="#Image Size Attributes">Image Size Attributes:</a></h3>
<p>The Image definition in HTML source file doesn’t include image width and height attributes which can create accessibility issues for the visitors and can increase the page load time. By including the image height and width the rendering time can be saved. 

<h3><a id="#Site Map">No Site Map:</a></h3>
<p>Stardom’s website has no site map present. It will make navigation even easier for those who are looking for specific information.

<h3><a id="#Layout">Layout:</a></h3>
<p>When viewed on desktop, the website shows blank space in second section of the page.I think blank space can be easily minimised by rearranging or changing the size of multimedia elements in this section. <br>
Also personally myself I would rearrange the whole layout from assymetrical to symmetrical one. Perhaps it is personal preference, but I think the symmetry brings the logic and clarification.
