<p>Multimedia is using images, sound, video and other media together and presenting information in a single presentation. 

<h3><a id="#Images"> Images </a></h3>
<p>This website is full of images as it is a Planetarium website. Everything is depicted in combination of image and related text. The main page alone contains 27 images.
<p>The two prominent image formats used in Stardome website are jpg and png. Both formats are web-friendly formats for providing prompt loading of the content of pages.

<p>On inspecting the html source code of the website I found that web developer of Stardom has not defined the image size attributes which will increase the page loading time.

<h3><a id="#Slide Show">Slide Show</a></h3>
<p> The Slide Show comes second from top after the main menu. I must say using slider for upcoming events is very impressive. The colour, images and text combination is putting life in each and every individual event listing. It is very engaging and visually attractive. There is no sound attached to the slide show and not too many slides. As a result the slide show provides a refreshing informative feature, but not overloading the website.

<h3><a id="#360º View Feature">360º View Feature</a></h3>
<p> 360º view are very useful feature for advertising such places. It gives a taste of what visitor can expect when visiting the place. It serves as a virtual tour to the Planetarium which is impressive and leaves the viewer curious and fascinated about the place.

<h3><a id="#Animation">Animation</a></h3>
<p>I did not find any animation on the website. Thinking as a web designer, animation could be a great feature at the sections advertising planetarium shows for children, but instead the web designer of the Observatory website decided to use video feature.

<h3><a id="#Sound, Video">Sound, Video</a></h3>
<p>There is no separate sound track attached to any of the parts of the web site. However, the web site placed a video feature streaming a trailer of selected shows off the YouTube. Definitely it enhances user experience.

<h3><a id="#Ad Banner">Ad Banner</a></h3>
<p>Due to this website is owned by the Auckland Council, there is no ad banner on the website.
