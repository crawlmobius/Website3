<p>The web site can be visited by users of different level of computer literacy. Therefore it is very important to consider all options to build user friendly web site. Usability of a website relies on few main points. One of them is a map of the site. Unfortunately the Stardome Web Site is missing the map of the site. Despite very clear structured menu and description, due to the website is quite big and contains a lot of information, there is a high chance to be lost among the pages. As a savior point the logo is presented on each page and serves as a graphical link to the main page from where user can start again.
<p> In regards to a textual content the web site is using quite simple and easy language.  
<p>Accessibility test EvalAccess shows following results: <br>
<div align="center">
<img src="Content/STARDOM SCREENSHOTS/9.JPG" width="510" height="162"  alt="Accessibility Results"/></div>
<p>It shows this website is full of warnings. There are 18 Priority 1 error and 5 Priority 2.
<p>I tried to get results from WAVE (web accessibility evaluation tool) but unfortunately for some reasons which were beyond my explanation, every time it gave me an error message (see the image below).
Seeing the result of the report could definitely give a lot of opportunities to a web master to improve the web site.

<p>One of the online Websites ranking website suggests Stardom.org.nz is the 1,693,063rd most popular website in the world. It is hard to make conclusion about this number, but as Stardome website oriented for particular location (Auckland, New Zealand) and for specific purpose being planetarium website, I think it has some popularity among local people and tourists.

  <h3>Google search listing:</h3>
<p>All the pages in of Stardom.org.nz are found to include meta description. This is important because search engines (like Google) show this text in search result pages.
  <p>This is how this website will look in Google search listings:
   <div align="center">
