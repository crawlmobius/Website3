<p>
The visual design theme of Stardome Observatory website follows the subject of planetarium and gives visitor an ambience of being in sky surrounded by stars. It has static background which is an image of Galaxy. The elements such as logo, buttons, drop down menu, calendar, all are repeated using the same line of colour palette. <br>
<p>The background image is quite dark, so it is reasonable why white colour was used for the text.  The contrast is maintained perfectly in the design and it helps different design elements stand out. The Font used in the Website is Gotham SSm A and B, which is quite easy to read. It is probably not ideally friendly combination from the statistical point of view, but it serves well for the current website theme giving the impression of mystery and wonder.
<p>The structure of source code of any webpage defines the design and content of page allowing the information to be easily published. The design of Stardom.co.nz is flexible and it can be viewed easily in multiple resolution and screens. 
<p>The combination of good and intelligent use of CSS and Javascripts, graphics, text and colours are wisely amalgamated to form an engaging and attractive website, where the good balance of image and text has made the images self-explanatory, whish is a big benefit due to it is not recommended to place too much text on the website.
<p>In general the website is abiding by the principles of design to a good level of degree. Below I provided couple of screenshots, which clearly give the feeling of the particular theme. <a href="#Visual Design">Go Up</a>

The layout of the website is assymetrical. It has top horizontal menu button bar with drop down boxes to extend the menu. Functionally drop down menu elements save a lot of space, keep the whole layout unclattered. Visually it gives a good structure to the page. As for the lower part of page, two thirds of vertical areas are noticably heavier with additional sections which repeating the parts of main menu. Obviously the most interesting sections which suppose to attract visitors were taken out and placed as a highlights.   
<p>It is good marketing step, but from the design point of view it breaks the consistency to some degree, because the calendar whish is on the first third of page is much lighter in weight. There is some feeling of unbalance. <a href="#Visual Design">Go Up</a>
