<h3><a id="Contrast">Contrast</a></h3>
<p>Following Design Principles I decided to keep my design theme in accordance to design theme of the website which I am doing my critique report on. I am using the similar galaxy images but much lighter in colour. This gives me an option to use black colour for my text to keep a good contrast between background and text colour palette. <br>
Also I adjusted the colour of the hyperlinks to make sure they are clearly visible but still stands out to the right degree.
 
 <h3><a id="Repetition">Repetition</a></h3>
 <p>I ensured the consistency throughout the website by repeating most of the elements such as the header, navigation bar, background to remain at the same place on each page. Additionaly, the CSS file is providing the consistency to the text and font size throughout all the pages. In my opinion the website now looks elegantly attractive, usable, .
